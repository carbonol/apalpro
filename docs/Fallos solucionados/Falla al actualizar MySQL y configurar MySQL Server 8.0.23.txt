NOTA: Esto es para un UPGRADE. Para un INSTALL en limpio, siga los pasos que anotaré después de estos.

Welcome Back!
Thank you for downloading and installing an updated MySQL installer for Windows bundle.
With this wizard you will be able to identify and install any upgrades for installed packages.
Simply click Next when you are ready to proceed.

Select Products to Upgrade
MySQL Server X64 architecture 8.0.26 to 8.0.32
Next >> Execute ... >> Next >> Next

Check and Upgrade Database
To maintain data integrity following a server upgrade, MySQL Installer must check your database and upgrade its system and data dictionary tables if neccesary.

This upgrade process is performed by MySQL Server, without relying on the mysql_upgrade client.
The server will be started, and then the data dictionary and system tables will be checked and upgraded automatically.
After this process finishes, the server will be able to accept incoming connections.

Skip system tables upgrade check and process (Not recommended). => NO! DON'T CHECK THIS!

Server File Permissions

MySQL Installer can secure the server's data directory by updating the permissions of files and folders located at:

C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data

Do you want MySQL Installer to update the server file permissions for you?

Options:
a) Yes, grant full access to the user running the Windows Service (if applicable) and the administrators group only. Other users and groups will not have access. [DEFAULT] => Choose this one, I suppose. I don't know how access levels should be configured, anyway.
b) Yes, but let me review and configure the level of access.
c) No, I will manage the permissions after the server configuration.

THIS IS GETTING SERIOUSLY WORRYING!

Let's delete the MySQL Server 8.0.32 and reinstall it again!
But do NOT delete the data directory!
Also, do NOT uninstall MySQL installer.

Now, let's reinstall!

Add...
Server only
Installs only the MySQL Server. This type should be used where you want to deploy a MySQL Server, but will not be developing MySQL applications.

Path Conflicts
Some products have path conflicts.
MySQL Server 8.0.32 Architecture X64

Let's keep the Install Directory and the Data Directory.
Install Directory:
C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0
Data Directory:
C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0

Continue and execute.

Then, configure MySQL Server 8.0.32

Configuration Type: Development Computer

Connectivity:
TCP/IP: Checked
Port: 3306
X Protocol Port: 33060

Next

Use Strong Password Encryption for Authentication (Recommended)
